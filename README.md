# Carl Rogers Chatbot

Example chatbot using the Microsoft Bot Framework, IBM Watson's NLU, and the Bot Builder Community's Watson NLU middleware for emotion detection to mimic a Rogerian therapist.

The intention with this chatbot is to show a tight loop of dialogs that repeat with different text prompts to encourage dialog based on the emotional output of the user.
